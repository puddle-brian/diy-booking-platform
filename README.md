# Book Yr Life - DIY Venue Discovery Platform

A modern platform connecting DIY music spaces with touring artists, inspired by the legendary "Book Your Own Fuckin' Life" zine (1992-2011).

## ðŸŽµ What We've Built

### **Fully Functional Homepage**
- **Artist/Space Toggle**: Airbnb-style interface switching between artist search and venue listing modes
- **Real-time Search**: Geographic and genre-based venue discovery
- **Dynamic Thumbnails**: Image-focused venue grid with fallback handling
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all devices

### **Database-Driven Content**
- **Venue Schema**: Comprehensive data model covering all DIY venue needs
- **Sample Data**: 5 realistic venues across different types (house shows, VFW halls, record stores, etc.)
- **CRUD Operations**: Full create, read, update, delete functionality
- **Image Requirements**: Enforced image uploads for visual discovery

### **Admin Interface**
- **Easy Venue Management**: Form-based venue addition at `/admin/venues`
- **Required Fields**: Name, location, contact, and at least one image
- **Rich Details**: Genres, equipment, capacity, pricing, features
- **Validation**: Proper error handling and success feedback

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Current Development Status

```

### Key Pages
