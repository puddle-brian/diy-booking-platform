- **ALWAYS ASK PERMISSION** before running any database commands
- **NO `--force-reset`** or destructive database operations without explicit approval
- **BACKUP FIRST** - Always create backups before any database modifications

## Vision Statement
Revive and modernize the legendary "Book Your Own Fuckin' Life" zine as a comprehensive digital platform that empowers DIY artists to book their own tours without gatekeepers. Fill the 13-year void left by BYOFL's demise by creating the ultimate resource for underground music scenes worldwide.

## Historical Context & Opportunity
**The Legacy:**
- Book Your Own Fuckin' Life (BYOFL) was the essential touring guide for DIY/punk bands 1992-2011
- Started as Maximum Rocknroll's "Book Your Own Fucking Tour" column in 1989
- Provided comprehensive listings of venues, bookers, bands, labels, radio stations, record stores, zines per state/province/country
- Enabled thousands of bands to tour independently, creating spider-webbing connections across underground scenes
- Died when MySpace/internet killed print zines, but no digital replacement ever matched its comprehensiveness

**The 13-Year Gap:**
- BYOFL website went offline in 2011 - nothing has filled this void
- Current tools (Master Tour, etc.) serve industry professionals, not DIY artists
- Underground scenes lack centralized resource for discovering authentic venues/communities
- DIY artists still need direct connections but have no systematic way to find them

**The Opportunity:**
Create the definitive digital successor that combines BYOFL's community-driven directory approach with modern technology's connectivity and real-time updates.

## Core Problem Statement
DIY artists and authentic venues need each other but have no systematic way to connect. The underground music ecosystem lacks a comprehensive, community-maintained resource for:
- Finding authentic DIY venues (not just commercial clubs)
- Connecting with scene-invested bookers (not corporate gatekeepers)  
- Discovering like-minded bands in other cities
- Accessing community infrastructure (labels, radio, record stores, zines)
- Building the personal networks that sustain touring careers
