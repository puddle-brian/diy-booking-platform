## Implementation in Profiles

To add media embeds to artist/venue profiles:

2. Use the MediaEmbedForm for adding/editing embeds
3. Display embeds using the MediaEmbed component
4. Store embed data (URL, title, description) in your database

```tsx
// Example profile structure
interface Profile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // ... other profile fields
  mediaEmbeds: {
    id: string;
    url: string;
    title: string;
    description?: string;
    order: number;
  }[];
}
```

## Technical Notes

- All embeds use iframe sandboxing for security
- Lazy loading improves page performance
- CSP (Content Security Policy) headers may need adjustment for iframe sources
- Consider rate limiting embed additions to prevent abuse
